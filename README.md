Final Project

My final Project is an online club/exhibition space inspired by my trip to Sonic Acts festival in Amsterdam. The user can immerse themselves by exploring the space, walking inside of the visuals and following the sounds of music. The space was made using three.js and the visuals are made with shaders inside the shadermaterial class. There are two songs playing from different areas inside the project this was achieved using the positional audio class. The biggest challenge was getting the pointer lock controls to work and in the end I decided to reverse engineer from this https://threejs.org/examples/#misc_controls_pointerlock example. I got rid of everything apart from the controls and built my project up from that. Other challanges included writing in the glsl which took alot of time to get used to but I found many good resources online to learn from.

Here I've listed the resources I've used in this project.

https://iquilezles.org/articles/warp/ - this was useful for learing and applying Fractal Brownian Motion inside the shaders https://ibreakdownshaders.blogspot.com/ - this was a tutorial on worley noise https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/670c22f3966e662d2f83 a GitHub Repo full of useful noise algorthims in glsl https://threejs.org/ the three.js website of course the images used are all downloaded from Adobe Stock
